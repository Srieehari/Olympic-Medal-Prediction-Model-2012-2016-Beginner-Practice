Project Overveiw

This is my first machine learning model. I used a linear regression line model to predict the amount of medals a country would win in future Olympic games using factors such as number of atheletes and current amount of medals. Although the model was not extremely accurate I learned many valuable functions that I plan to use in future models. These include the .corr() function ,.lmplot and many more.

Challenges and Future Improvements

One reason this model was innaccurate was because many factors were not linear in correlation. In the future I plan on using this data-set to possibly explore non linear relationships such as those betweent the age of an athlete and amount of medals. This could in turn help me develop a more accurate model and all together improve my coding skills
